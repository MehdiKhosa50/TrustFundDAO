# It's a Charity Funding Decentralzied Application
# The CEO of the organization is authorized to request funding. He provides a list of organizations seeking funding. Only contributors of the TrustFundDAO can vote on which organization will receive funding. Organizations that receive more than 50% of the votes will be funded. If the target is not met by the given date, contributors can withdraw their money.

# Only the CEO can make payments, but he must provide the organizationâ€™s address, description, and the amount of money being requested.
